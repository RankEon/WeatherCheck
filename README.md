# WeatherCheck

##Introduction
A basic weather application, which retrieves Finnish weather data from OpenWeatherMap, using the free API (for security reasons the application stored into the TFS/SCM does not contain API –key, thus You need to use your own API –key which is freely available from https://openweathermap.org/).

##Getting Started
To begin using the project or compiling it, please get your free API -key from OpenWeatherMap.org and store it into ./Resources/ApiKey.txt -file and you're good to go. Or alternatively after compiling and running the application for the first time, it will prompt for API -key if not set.
